              privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") in order to disclose our information gathering and
              dissemination practices. <br><br>
              
              While Company strongly encourages clients, affiliates and partners to adopt responsible

              affiliates and/or partners. The collection, use and disclosure of information by clients,
              affiliates and/or partners is subject to their respective privacy policies, which may differ

              When you visit the Site, we send a cookie and ("Cookie") to assign an anonymous, unique
              identifier to your Internet browser. A Cookie is a piece of data stored on your hard drive

              The use of Cookies by our third party tracking utility company is not covered by our Privacy
              Policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our third party tracking utility

              <br>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</br><br><br>
              
              Our third party tracking utility company employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a.
              Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our Site by informing us what
              content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function
              to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies,
              which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages
              and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information
              gathered by clear gifs to personally identifiable information.<br><br>
              
              Since the use of new technology including Cookies, web beacons, and other technology is rapidly
              evolving, as is our use of new and evolving technology, we may change or use additional or new
              technology from time to time.<br><br>

              from time to time, and Federal Trade Commission implementing regulations; and/or (iv) to protect
              the rights, property or safety of Company or others, including exchanging information with other
